Okay, um, I am a big fan.


--- Chunk 19 ---
Transcript:
of Sandra Bullock's work. I think she gets to do very interesting projects where, yes she does have some romantic projects that she does from time to time, but at the same time she does be more interesting character, utilizing for brains or sports kind of like in Gravity, but I also love how it's congeniality.


--- Chunk 21 ---
Transcript:
She was very, um, had a lot of comedy, so those were some interesting things. Alright, so... Oh, okay, so this did keep going, so for whatever reason it didn't in that one, but let's just keep testing this out. Um, one more character, one more character.


--- Chunk 23 ---
Transcript:
I do like Emilia Clarke's work. She, of course, everybody tends to speak to what she does with Game of Thrones, Mother of Dragons, but it is true. It is definitely something exciting and beautiful where we get to see her being very sweet and unassuming and then grow into a lot of strength and power. So it is a nice development there and I feel like she does have a romantic story that is empowering.


--- Chunk 25 ---
Transcript:
so i thought that was interesting. okay it stopped and i just realized i was not looking at the screen while i did that. great guys you get to listen to me say all that again. i do like um amelia clark's characters. she does good for oh more this is being glitchy that's a bummer okay


--- Chunk 27 ---
Transcript:
And then it goes to find your strength and others. Okay.


--- Chunk 29 ---
Transcript:
Um, right now, do you believe in actually being able to see those virtual slopes? No? Okay. I know!


--- Chunk 1 ---
Transcript:
No way. I feel like I can. I, uh, definitely both of these women are white and primarily have brunette hair.


--- Chunk 3 ---
Transcript:
hair and so that's an easy connection that we have here and I do have a certain level of fitness probably physically more in line with Amelia Clark's look so there's something there. Definitely both women have very expressive faces and I feel like that is something.


--- Chunk 5 ---
Transcript:
that I'm told I embody. All right. Okay, so I tried pressing. There we go. All right. That's great. You're recognizing some of the physical resemblance.


--- Chunk 7 ---
Transcript:
It seems you should pursue roles that showcase intelligent, resourceful, and strong human characters who can handle both dramatic and comedic. And who may undergo snooping. Does that sound...


--- Chunk 9 ---
Transcript:
Um, I feel like my current marking materials have elements of these, but they could definitely be improved. They're probably a little outdated. 


--- Chunk 11 ---
Transcript:
See, it's missing something, it's a little glitchy. I wonder if it's like this on a phone too. Okay. Some elements align. That's a great starting point. Before we leave here, we're going to get some more information. We'll connect this one we've already discussed. We're ready. 


--- Chunk 13 ---
Transcript:
Okay, let's hide in here.


--- Chunk 15 ---
Transcript:
I'm going to just keep testing out this mic just to see if we can find anything else in terms of similarities as to why this might be happening.


--- Chunk 17 ---
Transcript:
shoulder length, curly hair, kind of messy, a little bit wild, and brunette. I very rarely change my hair color. This is it. I don't really change my hair color. I don't use wigs. No, I don't.


--- Chunk 19 ---
Transcript:
Let's go up here and see. Uh, jes astronauta. Okay. Do you feel natural, it's really un- sweaty ain't it, a little bit more serene? At least, we like that we now know that this is the sometimes more stable way, so it's...


--- Chunk 21 ---
Transcript:
I'm just going to go ahead and start reading. Make any adjustments? Well, like, what do you feel like matches your... Well, that's fine. Okay. What do you... What ages do you feel like matches? One, two, three, five? I don't know. I just want to know what you do. Do you scrub your stuff? Okay. Let's try that. Um, I am definitely a woman and I enjoy dressing up and being, um, on the classier side, but certainly most...


--- Chunk 23 ---
Transcript:
the time I'm very laid-back and kind of tomboy, more of a jeans type girl. Yeah, it's just a little, feels a little slow in the responsiveness, but that's not that bad. Please upload, let's start with your headshots. Please upload one headshot you use most. The headshot you use most.


--- Chunk 25 ---
Transcript:
Okay, so let's go, let's go, go, go. Oh wait, no, no, no, sorry. Oh, all kinds of good stuff. Alright, let's try an old one. Lots of old good stuff.


--- Chunk 27 ---
Transcript:
Oh, I like this. This helps tell people that, like, oh, we're loading now. Bam! It's there! Okay. Proceeding to my initial presence is a good start. I hope someone else can hear me.
