staff members. Yeah, I do. Please, read on.


--- Chunk 1 ---
The middle cerebral has narrowed, it's less than two millimeters. You bypass the artery here and restore blood flow. Open her back.


--- Chunk 2 ---
My god, she's just been through a massive operation. The brain tissue hasn't settled. Another could very well stroke Katie out. Other options.


--- Chunk 3 ---
Intravascular. I don't see how an intravascular ultrasound gives us a better picture. I'm not imaging. He wants a stent in the middle cerebral artery in the angiolab. I like it.


--- Chunk 4 ---
is usually reserved for the heart and the carotid. It's not the usual, but we are way past the usual. It would lower the danger of a stroke.


--- Chunk 5 ---
Dr. Murphy, would you like to assist? Yes. Dr. Melendez, would you like to write me a letter of recommendation?


--- Chunk 6 ---
You see the narrowing there, and the horizontal segment of the middle cerebral artery. Recommendation. Yes.


--- Chunk 7 ---
Dr. Melendez, would you like to write me a letter of recommendation? You see the narrowing there?


--- Chunk 8 ---
a horizontal segment of the middle cerebral artery. Oh yeah, I've heard about you. You're the one making the old guard nervous.


--- Chunk 9 ---
Why would I make people nervous? Because you have a gift. And surgeons change.


--- Chunk 10 ---
themselves against their peers and right now you're winning. We're in position. Dr. Murphy, please inflate the balloon.


--- Chunk 11 ---
Give us another squirt of contrast, and we should have good blood flow.


--- Chunk 12 ---
I guess the proximal end of the artery is dissected. The balloon is damaging her artery. The reform is worsening. The stent won't hold. She's going to stretch.


--- Chunk 13 ---
Look, I'm aborting.


--- Chunk 14 ---
The form is normalizing right back where we started baby's brain is starving


--- Chunk 15 ---
I want to see Katie. I know she's in a coma. I still need to see her. I miss her. We can't risk contamination.


--- Chunk 16 ---
for either of you. She needs to know I'm there. We understand. You can't understand, no one can. We have always been there for each other and now when she needs me most.


--- Chunk 17 ---
I'm not there. You've just been through a 40-hour surgery. We need you to focus on your own healing. And what about her heart? We're going to do a cardiac catheterization test.


--- Chunk 18 ---
to see if her heart circulation has improved. Check the contrast to evaluate the heart's blood supply. How's my soul looking?


--- Chunk 19 ---
That's a different specialty. He says the eyes are the wind for the soul. I say the eyes love.


--- Chunk 20 ---
All in so far your soul is looking good strong unobstructed blood flow matriculogram will tell us how the muscle functions

--- Chunk 22 ---
It's so quiet. Is everything okay? Ventricles strained and dilated. We're hoping for some improvement post-separation, but it's barely pulmonary.


--- Chunk 23 ---
It just doesn't make any sense. The separation was supposed to relieve the stress on Jenny's heart. Half the need, half the work. Jenny's heart was even sicker than it appeared. Seems we couldn't see it.


--- Chunk 24 ---
because Katie's heart was doing all the work for Jenny's. What can we do to fix it? Give her a new heart. I'm not gonna find a donor match until... Yes, we already have the perfect heart for Jenny.
