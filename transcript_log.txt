Spider-Man 4 is going to be an absolute banger right after we finish watching No Way Home.


--- Chunk 3 ---
Transcript:
It was teased at the end that we were finally gonna get, in the next Spider-Man movie, a normal, street-level, New York City-swinging Spider-Man. And as time went on, we started hearing more and more horrible things about it. That it was going to be a multiversal film, that Ant-Man was going to be his partner in the whole movie, that it was going to cross into Sony's Spider-Man universe. And not only did we all hate this idea, but I even think Spider-Man himself hated it.

Think about English sentence structure, how do you...


--- Chunk 17 ---
Transcript:
sentences normally start? Think about the placement of articles, adjectives, adverbs, and think about, is it possible to have more than one answer? Hmm, maybe.

Transcript:
quickly she was running at the park in the morning okay she was quickly running at the park in the morning okay all right let's figure it out oh no I provided a false information for you so we need


--- Chunk 23 ---
Transcript:
in the park, my apologies, she was running quickly, she was running quickly in the park in the morning.


--- Chunk 25 ---
Transcript:
So in the park, because she's, you can imagine the park is a enclosed space, so in the park.


--- Chunk 27 ---
Transcript:
in the morning is what you want there in the morning. You can arrive for example you can get to the park and you can say I'm at the park to describe your location I'm at the park but it doesn't sound correct to say she was running at the park it would sound correct to say in the park so my apologies I


--- Chunk 29 ---
Transcript:
didn't notice that typo, makes it more difficult for you. She was running quickly in the park in the morning. To me, this sounds like the best order of words for normal English sentence structure. You could also start with a time reference and

say in the morning, she  said quickly running,  to say running quickly, running quickly.  quickly in the park

--- Chunk 1 ---
Transcript:
that question, why? Why is this correct? Now, to answer why something is correct, you can also answer why.


--- Chunk 3 ---
Transcript:
options are incorrect. Okay, I know A, B, C, D. I know one of them. That's definitely incorrect because it's used in a different way or this is definitely incorrect. That doesn't exist in English, for example. So you can answer why something is correct or you can also answer why something is incorrect. All right, the correct answer is D, pull over. You can pull over by the red house.


--- Chunk 5 ---
Transcript:
So this sounds like something you would tell a driver, a taxi driver, an Uber driver, or even a friend driving you, or a co-worker driving you, but they don't know where you live or where you're going, and you want to tell them. You can pull over by the red house. Now, if you say this, it means you're in a vehicle, because we use this with vehicles, and it means to move a vehicle to the side of the road and stop. So if you're driving, and then you see the red house,


--- Chunk 7 ---
Transcript:
you say, you can pull over by the red house. So a very useful phrasal verb to have in your vocabulary the next time you are in a taxi or in an Uber. Question six, Anvil did a great job on the presentation. Maria said sarcastically. Based on that, which is true? A, Maria is satisfied with Anvil's work. B, Maria is jealous of Anvil.

--- Chunk 9 ---
Transcript:
pronunciation, pities. Maria pities Anvil. Or D, Maria is not pleased with Anvil's work. Which is correct. Hmm, what do you think? Maria, how does Maria feel? And this is very important because understanding the meaning.
